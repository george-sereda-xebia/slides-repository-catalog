# Presales Reusable Assets - How to use

## Goal
This folder contains reusable presales building blocks.
Each asset is intentionally small (1–3 slides) and focused on a single idea, so presales teams can assemble proposals and RFP responses quickly without starting from scratch.

The goal is **speed, consistency, and clarity**, not perfect or exhaustive decks.

## Folder structure

- **Credibility**  
  Trust-building assets: company facts, global presence, client portfolios, values.  
  Use these to answer: *“Why should we trust Xebia?”*

- **Problem_Framing**  
  Framing the problem, challenge/solution mapping, decision drivers.  
  Use these to answer: *“What problem are we solving and why does it matter?”*

- **Delivery_Model**  
  How we deliver: approach, delivery phases, architecture and solution slides.  
  Use these to answer: *“How will we approach and build this?”*

- **Engagement_Model**  
  How we work together: team setup, governance, collaboration and partnership models.  
  Use these to answer: *“How will we work with the client and their teams?”*

- **Estimation**  
  Estimation principles, sizing models, drivers and trade-offs.  
  No customer-specific pricing, rates, or commercial terms.

## Core principles

1. **One file = one idea**  
   Each asset should cover a single concept (1–3 slides max).

2. **Reusable does not mean copy & paste**  
   Assets may contain examples or illustrative data.

3. **Clarity over completeness**  
   Assets are building blocks, not full presentations.

4. **If it requires long explanations, it doesn’t belong here**  
   Either simplify it or keep it in customer-specific materials.

## About customer names and example data

Some reusable assets may still contain customer names, logos, or concrete data points.
These should be treated as **examples**, not as ready-to-use content.

Rule of thumb:
- Customer names, numbers, timelines, and diagrams are illustrative.
- When reusing an asset in a new presales context, all example data must be reviewed and replaced with client-specific information.

Assets containing examples are meant to:
- show structure,
- illustrate an approach,
- support storytelling,

**not** to be copied unchanged into a proposal.

## Naming convention

Format:
`<Topic>_<Intent>.pptx`


### Types

- **Intro**  
  Section divider only.  
  No client-specific content.  
  Safe to reuse as-is.

- **Example**  
  Illustrative slide(s) based on a real case.  
  Contains customer-specific data and **must be adapted before reuse**.

### Examples
- `Proposed_Approach_Intro.pptx`
- `Discovery_and_Delivery_Intro.pptx`
- `Platform_Modernization_Example.pptx`

## Adding new assets

When adding a new asset:
1. Extract it into a new `.pptx` file.
2. Rename it using the naming convention.
3. Ensure it follows the “one file = one idea” rule.
4. Place it in the correct folder.

## When NOT to add to reusable assets

- Customer-specific financials, rates, or commercial terms
- Legally binding commitments
- Detailed staffing or timelines that cannot be meaningfully adapted
- Anything that only makes sense for a single client and context
